**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

To include ethics and inequity components into my previous work, it is important to understand what type of data the dataset has. The farmerâ€™s market data has important information about vendors, products, and customers. 

In terms of ethics, it is crucial to be transparent with the vendors and the customers about the information being kept on record and how the data will be used. Both vendors and customers must have the right to request the deletion of their information from the database.

In terms of inequity, the data in the dataset must be unbiased and without stereotypes or discrimination.

Another important aspect is to have regular audits of the database to ensure that all the information is accurate and accountable.
